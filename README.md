# Online Retail Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing an **Online Retail dataset** to uncover key insights and trends in sales, products, and customer behavior. The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization using Python.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **InvoiceNo**: Invoice number of the transaction
- **StockCode**: Unique code of the product
- **Description**: Description of the product
- **Quantity**: Quantity of the product in the transaction
- **InvoiceDate**: Date and time of the transaction
- **UnitPrice**: Unit price of the product
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier of the customer
- **Country**: Country where the transaction occurred

## Key Tasks Performed
1. **Loading the Dataset**: Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values by removing records with missing `CustomerID`.
   - Removed duplicate rows.
   - Converted `InvoiceDate` to a datetime format for time-based analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Descriptive statistics were computed to explore the central tendency, variability, and distribution of the data.
   - Key statistics such as the mean, median, and standard deviation were explored.
4. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Histograms**: To visualize the distribution of `Quantity` and `UnitPrice`.
   - **Bar plots**: Displayed the top 10 selling products and countries.
   - **Scatter plots**: Showed the relationship between `Quantity` and `UnitPrice`.
5. **Sales Trend Analysis**:
   - Identified the busiest months and days of the week in terms of sales.
6. **Top-Selling Products and Countries**:
   - Found the most popular products and countries based on the total quantity sold.
7. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Used box plots to detect anomalies in `Quantity` and `UnitPrice`.
   - Discussed potential impacts of outliers on analysis.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following key sections:
- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing and cleaning the raw dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the dataset to extract valuable insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing different aspects of the data to understand trends and patterns.
- **Sales Trends**: Analyzing sales trends over time, and identifying key periods for business optimization.
- **Outlier Analysis**: Identifying extreme values in the data and discussing their impact on the analysis.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Main programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations to represent trends and insights.
- **Numpy**: For handling numerical operations.
